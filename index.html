    <h2>Introduction to Neuroscience and Brain Function</h2>
    <p>The brain is like a group of experts. All the parts of the brain work together, but each part has its own special
        responsibilities. The brain can be divided into three basic units: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the
        hindbrain.

        The hindbrain includes the upper part of the spinal cord, the brain stem, and a wrinkled ball of tissue called
        the cerebellum. The hindbrain controls the bodys vital functions such as respiration and heart rate.

        The cerebellum coordinates movement and is involved in learned movements. When you play the piano or hit a
        tennis ball, you are activating the cerebellum.

        The uppermost part of the brainstem is the midbrain, which controls some reflex actions and is part of the
        circuit involved in the control of eye movements and other voluntary movements. The forebrain is the largest and
        most highly developed part of the human brain: it consists primarily of the cerebrum and the structures hidden
        beneath it (see "The Inner Brain").

        When people see pictures of the brain it is usually the cerebrum that they notice. The cerebrum sits at the
        topmost part of the brain and is the source of conscious thoughts and actions. It holds your memories and allows
        you to plan, imagine, and think. It allows you to recognize friends, read, and play games.</p>
    <p>The cerebrum is split into two halves (hemispheres) by a deep fissure. The two cerebral hemispheres communicate
        with each other through a thick tract of nerve fibers that lies at the base of this fissure, called the corpus
        callosum. Although the two hemispheres seem to be mirror images of each other, they are different. For instance,
        the ability to form words seems to lie primarily in the left hemisphere, while the right hemisphere seems to
        control many abstract reasoning skills.</p>

    <h2>Neuroplasticity : How the brain Adapts and changes</h2>
    <p>The two frontal lobes lie directly behind the forehead. When you plan a schedule, imagine the future, or use
        reasoned arguments, these two lobes do much of the work. One of the ways the frontal lobes seem to do these
        things is by acting as short-term storage sites, allowing one idea to be kept in mind while other ideas are
        considered.</p>

            <h2>Mental Health: Overview of Mental Health and Its Importance</h2>
            <p>The brain is one of the hardest working organs in the body. When the brain is healthy it functions quickly and automatically. But when problems occur, the results can be devastating. NINDS supports research on hundreds of neurological disorders. Knowing more about the brain can lead to the development of new treatments for diseases and disorders of the nervous system and improve many areas of human health.</p>
            <p>The brain and the rest of the nervous system are composed of many different types of cells, but the primary functional unit is a cell called the neuron. All sensations, movements, thoughts, memories, and feelings are the result of signals that pass through neurons. Neurons consist of three parts: the cell body, dendrites, and the axon.</p>
